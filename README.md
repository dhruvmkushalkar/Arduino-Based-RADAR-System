# Arduino-Based-RADAR-System

In this project, we have designed Arduino RADAR Model using Ultrasonic Sensor for Detection and Servo motor . RADAR is an object detection system that uses radio waves to identify the range, altitude, direction, and speed of the objects.
In this  Arduino RADAR project ,we aims to achieve a radar system prototype based on an Arduino board, capable of detecting  objects.
